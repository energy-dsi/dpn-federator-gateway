# File Streaming (Server → Client) — Federator

## Overview

This document explains the Federator file streaming capability, which sends files from the server to clients over gRPC as a sequence of chunks. It covers the architecture, stream/chunk protocol, configuration, offsets/resume semantics, storage providers, error handling, and testing guidance.

**Note:** This document was previously named `FILE_STREAMINING_README.md` (with a typo) and has been renamed to `FILE_STREAMING_README.md`.

Key highlights:
- gRPC bidirectional-style server streaming (`GetFilesStream`) delivering `FileStreamEvent` messages containing either `FileChunk` or `StreamWarning`.
- Deterministic chunking with a configurable `chunkSize` on the server.
- End-of-file signaled via a final chunk with `is_last_chunk = true` and `file_checksum` (SHA-256).
- Graceful error handling: server sends `StreamWarning` for deserialization/validation errors without terminating the stream.
- Resume support using `start_sequence_id` to continue from a previously received point.
- Producer supports multiple source providers: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage (GCP), plus Local file system.
- Consumer supports AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage (GCP) as the final destination; local disk may be used for temporary assembly.
- Pluggable storage providers (LOCAL, S3, AZURE, GCP) for reading and writing files or parts.

## Architecture

At a high level, a client requests a file stream from the Federator server. The server locates and reads the source file (via `FileProvider` implementations) from S3, Azure, GCP, or Local and streams chunks to the client. The client assembles and verifies integrity using the final checksum. On the consumer side, the final destination is S3, Azure, or GCP, with bucket/container configured in `client.properties` and the object path resolved from database configuration.

### Server-side components
- `FederatorService.proto` defines `GetFilesStream(FileStreamRequest) returns (stream FileStreamEvent)`.
- `FileKafkaEventMessageProcessor` deserializes and validates Kafka messages; on error, emits `StreamWarning` instead of terminating the stream.
- `FileChunkStreamer` reads the file in `chunkSize` blocks, emits `FileChunk` messages wrapped in `FileStreamEvent`, and sends a final last-chunk with checksum.
- `FileProviderFactory` resolves the concrete `FileProvider` for the configured source type (LOCAL, S3, Azure, GCP).

### Client-side components
- A gRPC client (`ClientGRPCJob` orchestrator and related handlers) initiates the stream request, consumes chunks, writes temporary parts, and finalizes the file.
- Client storage is pluggable for temp assembly and final destination (LOCAL, S3, AZURE, or GCP) via implementations such as `S3ReceivedFileStorage`, `AzureReceivedFileStorage`, and `GCPReceivedFileStorage`.

## Tech Stack

- gRPC + Protobuf (`FederatorService.proto` → generated stubs in `uk.gov.dbt.ndtp.grpc`)
- Java (server and client components)
- Storage providers: Local filesystem, AWS S3 or S3-compatible such as MinIO, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage (GCP)
- Redis and Kafka exist in the broader system; file streaming can be used alongside other data paths

## Getting Started

1. Generate and build the project:
   - `mvn clean package`
2. Start local dependencies (optional demo):
   - See `docker/docker-grpc-resources` for example environments such as MinIO S3 and Azurite Azure. Start the relevant compose file if needed.
3. Configure client properties (see Configuration below), especially storage provider and directories/buckets.
4. Run server and client processes. The client invokes `GetFilesStream` and writes assembled files to the configured storage.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    dev[Dev Machine] -->|mvn package| build[[Build]]
    build --> runServer[Run Federator Server]
    build --> runClient[Run Federator Client]
    subgraph Optional Services

        redis[Redis]
        minio[MinIO or S3]
    end
    runServer -->|serve gRPC| runClient
    runClient -->|receive chunks| minio
```

## Configuration

Primary client settings are in `src/configs/client.properties`:
- Storage provider
  - `client.files.storage.provider` = `LOCAL` | `S3` | `AZURE` | `GCP` (default `LOCAL`)
- Local storage
  - `client.files.temp.dir` — directory for received files and temporary parts
  
### Local temp directory (`client.files.temp.dir`)

- Purpose: This directory is used by the client to assemble incoming chunks. During transfer, parts are written to `<base>/.parts/<file>.<seq>.part`. On the final chunk, the `.part` file is moved to `<base>/<file>` and then handed off to the configured storage provider (LOCAL, S3, AZURE, or GCP).
- Defaults: If the property is blank or missing, it falls back to `${java.io.tmpdir}/federator-files`.
- Cleanup behavior:
  - Success to remote (S3, Azure, or GCP): The assembled local file is best-effort deleted by the remote storage provider after upload.
  - Upload failure: The remote provider also attempts to delete the assembled local file and does not advance offsets.
  - Integrity failure (checksum/size): The assembler deletes the `.part` file and aborts.
  - Interruption/crash: A stale `.part` may remain; you can safely remove `*.part` files that are older than your retention window.
- Production guidance: For large files, mount this path on durable storage with sufficient space. Recommended capacity = peak concurrent files × maximum file size + 20-30% headroom. Ensure the process user has read/write permissions and monitor disk usage.
- S3 settings (also used by server-side components in some deployments)
  - `files.s3.bucket`
  - `aws.s3.region`
  - `aws.s3.access.key.id`
  - `aws.s3.secret.access.key`
  - `aws.s3.endpoint.url` (S3-compatible systems like MinIO)
  - `aws.s3.profile` (SSO/local profiles)

- Azure settings (also used by server-side components in some deployments)
  - `files.azure.container`
  - `azure.storage.connection.string`

- GCP settings (also used by server-side components in some deployments)
  - `files.gcp.bucket`
  - `gcp.storage.project.id`
  - `gcp.storage.credentials.file`
  - `gcp.storage.endpoint.url`

### S3 settings — when to set and when to leave blank

The following guidance explains which S3 properties must be set or left blank for common deployment scenarios. The client uses an AWS SDK–style credential resolution (via `S3ClientFactory`) and supports static keys, shared profiles/SSO, or instance/role credentials. Only configure one credentials method at a time.

- files.s3.bucket
  - Set: Always required for the consumer because the final destination is S3 (including S3-compatible like MinIO). The bucket may be a real AWS bucket or a MinIO bucket name.
  - Blank: Only permissible if the consumer is not writing to S3 at all (e.g., local testing where the consumer is not invoked or S3 writes are disabled). In normal consumer runs, do not leave blank.

- aws.s3.region
  - Set: Recommended for AWS. If using static keys or profile, set the AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-2`). For MinIO or other S3-compatible endpoints, set to a placeholder like `us-east-1` if the SDK requires a non-empty region.
  - Blank: Acceptable when the region is resolvable from the environment, profile, or instance metadata. Not recommended for local dev as it can be ambiguous.

- aws.s3.access.key.id and aws.s3.secret.access.key
  - Set: For static IAM user credentials or S3-compatible systems like MinIO. Use together as a pair.
  - Blank: When using `aws.s3.profile` (shared config/SSO) or IAM role credentials on EC2/ECS/Lambda (instance/role provider). Also leave blank if relying on environment variables or default provider chain that supplies credentials.

- aws.s3.endpoint.url
  - Set: Only for S3-compatible systems (e.g., MinIO). Example: `http://localhost:9000`.
  - Blank: For real AWS S3 — do not set an endpoint.

- aws.s3.profile
  - Set: When using shared AWS config/credentials profile (including AWS SSO). Example: `default` or `my-sso-profile`.
  - Blank: For static keys, IAM role credentials, or MinIO when providing access/secret directly. Do not set a profile and static keys at the same time.

### Common scenarios and property examples

1) AWS S3 with static access keys
```
files.s3.bucket=my-prod-bucket
aws.s3.region=eu-west-2
aws.s3.access.key.id=AKIA...
aws.s3.secret.access.key=...
aws.s3.endpoint.url=
aws.s3.profile=
```

2) AWS S3 with shared profile (including SSO)
```
files.s3.bucket=my-dev-bucket
aws.s3.region=eu-west-2            # optional if region is in the profile; recommended to set
aws.s3.access.key.id=
aws.s3.secret.access.key=
aws.s3.endpoint.url=
aws.s3.profile=my-sso-profile
```

3) AWS S3 with IAM role on EC2/ECS/Lambda
```
files.s3.bucket=service-bucket
aws.s3.region=eu-west-2            # or leave blank to auto-resolve from instance metadata
aws.s3.access.key.id=
aws.s3.secret.access.key=
aws.s3.endpoint.url=
aws.s3.profile=
```

4) S3‑compatible (MinIO) local development
```
files.s3.bucket=minio-bucket
aws.s3.region=us-east-1            # commonly required placeholder for MinIO
aws.s3.access.key.id=minioadmin
aws.s3.secret.access.key=minioadmin
aws.s3.endpoint.url=http://localhost:9000
aws.s3.profile=
```

### Azure settings — when to set and when to leave blank

The client and server use Azure configuration via `AzureBlobClientFactory` with two options: a connection string or an endpoint URL. If both are provided, the connection string takes precedence.

- files.azure.container
  - Set: Required for the consumer when the final destination is Azure. This is the target container name.
  - Blank: Only permissible if the consumer is not writing to Azure (e.g., using S3 or LOCAL for destination).

- azure.storage.connection.string
  - Set: Recommended for local/dev and Azurite. For real Azure, you can also use the storage account connection string if desired.
  - Blank: Allowed if you configure `azure.storage.endpoint` instead (for managed identity/service principal flows).

- azure.storage.endpoint
  - Set: Use for production when authenticating with DefaultAzureCredential (e.g., Managed Identity or Service Principal). Example: `https://<account-name>.blob.core.windows.net`.
  - Blank: Allowed if you provide `azure.storage.connection.string` instead.

### Common Azure scenarios and property examples

5) Azure Blob Storage (real Azure) — using connection string
```
client.files.storage.provider=AZURE
files.azure.container=my-prod-container
azure.storage.connection.string=DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=...;AccountKey=...;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
```

6) Azure Blob Storage (real Azure) — using endpoint with DefaultAzureCredential
```
client.files.storage.provider=AZURE
files.azure.container=my-prod-container
azure.storage.endpoint=<<your specific value>>
# No connection string set; authentication resolved by DefaultAzureCredential
```

7) Azurite local development
```
client.files.storage.provider=AZURE
files.azure.container=dev-container
# Default Azurite connection string (Docker compose often exposes 10000/10001)
azure.storage.connection.string=DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFeqCdt8x3Pp0G...==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;
```

### GCP settings — when to set and when to leave blank

The client and server use GCP configuration via `GcsClientFactory` with support for service account credentials or Application Default Credentials (ADC). ADC automatically resolves credentials from environment variables, gcloud CLI, or GCE/GKE metadata.

- files.gcp.bucket
  - Set: Required for the consumer when the final destination is GCP. This is the target GCS bucket name.
  - Blank: Only permissible if the consumer is not writing to GCP (e.g., using S3, Azure, or LOCAL for destination).

- gcp.storage.project.id
  - Set: Optional. If set, this project ID will be used for GCS operations.
  - Blank: When not set, the project ID is resolved from the service account credentials file or from the environment (e.g., GCE/GKE metadata).

- gcp.storage.credentials.file
  - Set: Path to a service account JSON key file. Use this for explicit service account authentication.
  - Blank: When not set, the system uses Application Default Credentials (ADC), which checks the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, gcloud CLI config, or GCE/GKE metadata service.

- gcp.storage.endpoint.url
  - Set: Only for GCS-compatible emulators like fake-gcs-server during local testing. Example: `http://localhost:4443`.
  - Blank: For real Google Cloud Storage — do not set an endpoint. When set, NoCredentials will be used automatically for emulator compatibility.

### Common GCP scenarios and property examples

8) GCP with service account key file
```
client.files.storage.provider=GCP
files.gcp.bucket=my-prod-bucket
gcp.storage.project.id=my-gcp-project
gcp.storage.credentials.file=/path/to/service-account-key.json
gcp.storage.endpoint.url=
```

9) GCP with Application Default Credentials (production)
```
client.files.storage.provider=GCP
files.gcp.bucket=my-prod-bucket
gcp.storage.project.id=           # optional; resolved from credentials or environment
gcp.storage.credentials.file=     # uses ADC: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS env var, gcloud, or GCE/GKE metadata
gcp.storage.endpoint.url=
```

10) GCP with fake-gcs-server (local development)
```
client.files.storage.provider=GCP
files.gcp.bucket=test-bucket
gcp.storage.project.id=test-project
gcp.storage.credentials.file=
gcp.storage.endpoint.url=http://localhost:4443
```

### Dos and Don'ts
- Do configure only one credential source: static keys OR profile/SSO OR IAM role. Mixing profile and keys can cause ambiguous resolution.
- Do set the correct destination property for the selected provider:
  - For S3: `files.s3.bucket`
  - For Azure: `files.azure.container`
  - For GCP: `files.gcp.bucket`
- Don’t set `aws.s3.endpoint.url` for real AWS S3; it is meant for S3‑compatible endpoints like MinIO.
- Don’t leave both keys and profile populated; choose exactly one.

- Streaming (server-side)
  - `file.stream.chunk.size` — chunk size in bytes used by the server when streaming files. If not set, defaults to `1000000` bytes (1 MB). This is read by the server (e.g., in `FileKafkaEventMessageProcessor`) to construct `FileChunkStreamer`.

Producer vs Consumer specifics:
- Producer
  - Supports reading from S3, Azure, GCP, or Local depending on the message `sourceType`.
  - For Azure, use Azurite or a real Azure Storage account; for GCP, use fake-gcs-server or real Google Cloud Storage; provider configuration is resolved by the platform components behind `FileProviderFactory`.
- Consumer
  - Final destination is AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage (GCP). Temporary parts may be written to local disk depending on `client.files.storage.provider`.
  - For S3: bucket name comes from `files.s3.bucket` in `client.properties`.
  - For Azure: container name comes from `files.azure.container` in `client.properties`.
  - For GCP: bucket name comes from `files.gcp.bucket` in `client.properties`.
  - The object destination key/prefix (for S3), blob path (for Azure), or object name (for GCP) comes from database-resident consumer configuration.

Networking and TLS (if enabled):
- `client.p12FilePath`, `client.p12Password`, `client.truststoreFilePath`, `client.truststorePassword`

Other relevant system options include Redis/Kafka groups, retry back-off, and topic prefixing used elsewhere in the broader system.

### Topic Message Schema

Messages pushed to the topic use a JSON payload indicating the source of the file to stream. Example:

```json
{
  "sourceType": "S3",
  "storageContainer": "s3-heg",
  "path": "intellij-java-google-style.xml"
}
```

Fields:
- `sourceType` — the origin provider of the file. Allowed values: `S3`, `AZURE`, `GCP`, `LOCAL` (case-sensitive; all caps).
- `storageContainer` — container name for the file source:
  - For `S3`: the bucket name.
  - For `AZURE`: the blob container name.
  - For `GCP`: the GCS bucket name.
  - For `LOCAL`: optional label; actual base directory is resolved by the Local provider configuration.
- `path` — the object key or file path within the container:
  - For `S3`: the object key within the bucket.
  - For `AZURE`: the blob name within the container.
  - For `GCP`: the object name within the GCS bucket.
  - For `LOCAL`: the file path relative to the configured base directory.

Notes:
- The message schema selects the producer-side `FileProvider`. The gRPC API remains the same regardless of source.
- Consumer destination (S3, Azure, or GCP) is configured separately: bucket/container from properties, destination key/path/prefix from database configuration.

## gRPC APIs

Defined in `src/main/proto/FederatorService.proto`:

- `rpc GetFilesStream(FileStreamRequest) returns (stream FileStreamEvent)`
  - Request: `FileStreamRequest`
    - `Topic` — optional logical topic or collection identifier used by the server to choose files
    - `start_sequence_id` — resume point; `0` means from the beginning
  - Response stream: `FileStreamEvent` — a oneof message containing either a `FileChunk` or a `StreamWarning`
    - `FileChunk` — carries file data or final metadata
      - `file_name` — logical or source name
      - `chunk_data` — bytes for the data chunk (omitted for the final last-chunk)
      - `chunk_index` — zero-based index for the chunk
      - `total_chunks` — total count (known for data chunks; repeated on final chunk)
      - `is_last_chunk` — `true` when the final, metadata-only chunk is sent
      - `file_checksum` — SHA-256 of the full file (only set on the last chunk)
      - `file_size` — size in bytes of the full file
      - `file_sequence_id` — monotonically increasing identifier for files in a stream
    - `StreamWarning` — indicates the server skipped a sequence due to an error
      - `skipped_sequence_id` — the file sequence id that was skipped
      - `reason` — classification of the error (`DESERIALIZATION`, `VALIDATION`, etc.)
      - `details` — human-readable error message

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class FileStreamRequest {
      string Topic
      int64 start_sequence_id
    }
    class FileStreamEvent {
      <<oneof>>
      FileChunk chunk
      StreamWarning warning
    }
    class FileChunk {
      string file_name
      bytes chunk_data
      int32 chunk_index
      int32 total_chunks
      bool is_last_chunk
      string file_checksum
      int64 file_size
      int64 file_sequence_id
    }
    class StreamWarning {
      int64 skipped_sequence_id
      string reason
      int64 details
    }
    FileStreamEvent --> FileChunk
    FileStreamEvent --> StreamWarning
```

## Storage Providers

Server read path uses `FileProviderFactory` → `FileProvider`:
- LOCAL: reads from a local filesystem path.
- S3: reads from a configured S3 bucket and key.
- AZURE: reads from a configured Azure Blob container and blob name.
- GCP: reads from a configured GCS bucket and object name.

Client write path uses pluggable storage implementations:
- LOCAL: write parts to `client.files.temp.dir`, then assemble.
- S3: `S3ReceivedFileStorage` uploads to Amazon S3 (or S3-compatible) using bucket from `files.s3.bucket`.
- AZURE: `AzureReceivedFileStorage` uploads to Azure Blob Storage using container from `files.azure.container`.
- GCP: `GCPReceivedFileStorage` uploads to Google Cloud Storage using bucket from `files.gcp.bucket`.

    end
```

## Streaming & Chunking

- Chunk size is configured server-side when constructing `FileChunkStreamer` (e.g., via application configuration). It determines throughput and memory usage trade-offs.
- For each chunk:
  - `chunk_index` increments from `0`.
  - `total_chunks` is included with every message to aid progress calculation.
  - `file_size` is included.
  - The server maintains a SHA-256 digest over all chunk bytes.
- After the last data chunk, the server sends a final control message with `is_last_chunk = true`, `file_checksum` set, and the next `chunk_index` value (i.e., `lastChunkIndex`).

### Client assembly lifecycle

- Incoming chunks are written to `<client.files.temp.dir>/.parts` as a single growing `.part` file per stream/file.
- On the last chunk (after checksum/size verification), the `.part` is moved atomically to `<client.files.temp.dir>/<fileName>`.
- The configured client storage provider is invoked:
  - LOCAL: the final file remains under `client.files.temp.dir`.
  - S3: the final file is uploaded and then deleted locally by the S3 provider (best-effort).
  - AZURE: the final file is uploaded and then deleted locally by the Azure provider (best-effort).
  - GCP: the final file is uploaded and then deleted locally by the GCP provider (best-effort).

Provider note: Chunking and checksumming are provider-agnostic; the same streaming protocol applies whether the source is `S3`, `Azure`, `GCP`, or `Local`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Server
    participant C as Client
    loop chunks
        S-->>C: FileStreamEvent{FileChunk{chunk_data, chunk_index}}
        C-->>C: write part and update progress
    end
    S-->>C: FileStreamEvent{FileChunk{is_last_chunk=true, file_checksum}}
    C-->>C: verify checksum equals computed SHA-256
    alt Warning for skipped file
        S-->>C: FileStreamEvent{StreamWarning{skipped_sequence_id, reason}}
        C-->>C: log warning + advance offset
    end
```

## Offset Management

Two levels of progress are commonly tracked:
1) File sequence — `file_sequence_id` identifies each file in order.
2) In-file progress — `chunk_index` for partial assembly.

Clients can persist `file_sequence_id` and optionally last fully assembled file. To resume, set `start_sequence_id` in the request.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Have saved file_sequence_id?}
    B -- No --> C[Use 0 from beginning]
    B -- Yes --> D[Set start_sequence_id = saved]
    C --> E[Request stream]
    D --> E[Request stream]
    E --> F[Receive chunks]
    F --> G{Final chunk received?}
    G -- No --> F
    G -- Yes --> H[Verify checksum]
    H --> I{OK?}
    I -- Yes --> J[Persist new sequence id]
    I -- No --> K[Initiate retry/re-fetch]
```

If the client also tracks partial assembly by `chunk_index`, it can discard duplicates upon resume and continue appending, or restart the file depending on policy.

## Error Handling & Retry

### Server-side exception handling

The server uses a graceful error handling approach for per-file errors without terminating the entire stream:

- **Deserialization errors**: When the server cannot parse a Kafka message as a valid `FileTransferRequest` (e.g., malformed JSON), it classifies the error as `DESERIALIZATION`.
- **Validation errors**: When the parsed request fails validation (e.g., blank path or null request), it classifies the error as `VALIDATION`.
- **StreamWarning emission**: Instead of terminating the stream, the server sends a `StreamWarning` message with:
  - `skipped_sequence_id` — the file sequence id that could not be processed
  - `reason` — `DESERIALIZATION` or `VALIDATION`
  - `details` — the exception message for diagnostics
- The stream continues, allowing subsequent files to be processed.

#### Unrecoverable scenarios

Certain errors cannot be recovered through retries and require the client to skip the problematic sequence to avoid infinite loops:

- **Invalid JSON file**: When the Kafka message payload is not valid JSON or contains syntax errors, the server cannot deserialize it into a `FileTransferRequest`. The server sends a `StreamWarning` with `reason=DESERIALIZATION`.
- **Incorrect file path**: When the file path in the message is blank, null, or points to a non-existent resource, validation fails. The server sends a `StreamWarning` with `reason=VALIDATION`.
- **Malformed request structure**: When required fields are missing or have invalid types in the JSON payload, deserialization or validation fails.

For all such scenarios:
1. The server logs the error and sends `StreamWarning` to the client with the `skipped_sequence_id`.
2. The client receives the warning, logs it, and **immediately advances the offset in Redis** to `skipped_sequence_id + 1`.
3. This offset jump prevents the client from re-processing the same broken message indefinitely.
4. The stream continues with the next valid message.

#### Exception handling check flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Kafka Event Received] --> Deserialize{Deserialize JSON}
    Deserialize -->|Success| Validate{Validate Request}
    Deserialize -->|Exception| ClassifyDeser[Classify as DESERIALIZATION]
    Validate -->|Valid| Stream[Stream File Chunks]
    Validate -->|Invalid| ClassifyValid[Classify as VALIDATION]
    ClassifyDeser --> EmitWarning[Emit StreamWarning]
    ClassifyValid --> EmitWarning
    EmitWarning --> Continue[Continue to Next Event]
    Stream --> Success[File Streamed Successfully]
    Success --> Continue
```

### Client-side exception handling

- **StreamWarning handling (offset jumping)**: When the client receives a `StreamWarning`, it:
  1. Logs the warning with `skipped_sequence_id`, `reason`, and `details` for diagnostics.
  2. **Immediately updates the Redis offset** to `skipped_sequence_id + 1` (or uses the value directly from the warning if the server has already incremented it).
  3. This offset jump ensures the client will not retry the same unrecoverable message (e.g., invalid JSON, incorrect file path) on the next stream request, preventing infinite loops.
  4. The stream continues processing subsequent messages without interruption.
- **Integrity verification**: If checksum mismatches on a `FileChunk`, the client must treat the file as incomplete/corrupt and retry from a safe point.
- **Retry strategy**: Client should implement retry with exponential back-off. Suggested options mirror standard properties used elsewhere in the project (e.g., `retries.max_attempts`, `retries.initial_backoff`, `retries.max_backoff`, `retries.forever`).

### Additional considerations

- Azure producer source: handle authentication and container resolution errors, including SAS token expiry, missing containers, or network timeouts.
- GCP producer source: handle authentication and bucket resolution errors, including service account credential issues, missing buckets, permission errors, or network timeouts.
- Consumer destination: if the bucket from `client.properties` is missing or the destination path from the database cannot be resolved, treat as configuration error and fail fast with clear logs for remediation.
- Fatal stream errors: Network failures or unrecoverable gRPC errors still produce `Status.INTERNAL` and terminate the stream, requiring client reconnection.

## Testing

- Unit tests
  - Validate chunk counting and boundary conditions (exact multiples of `chunkSize`, very small files, empty files).
  - Verify checksum emission matches a standalone SHA-256 of the file.
  - Ensure `is_last_chunk` semantics and `total_chunks` consistency.
- Integration tests
  - End-to-end stream with LOCAL storage.
  - End-to-end stream with MinIO S3 using `aws.s3.endpoint.url` and `files.s3.bucket`.
  - End-to-end stream with Azurite Azure as producer source; consumer can write to S3, Azure, GCP, or LOCAL.
  - End-to-end stream with fake-gcs-server as GCP producer source; consumer can write to S3, Azure, GCP, or LOCAL.
  - Resume behavior using `start_sequence_id`.
  - Validate topic JSON schema parsing and routing to correct `FileProvider` based on `sourceType`.
- Performance testing
  - Use `docker/docker-grpc-resources/performance-tests` scaffolding to drive large files and different chunk sizes.
